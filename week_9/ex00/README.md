# Instructions
**Objective:** Create functions which replicate some of those in [`<cmath>`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/).

## Background information
Header `<cmath>` declares a set of functions to compute common mathematical operations and transformations. These functions are defined in some file on your system, we are going to try to recreate a few of those functions.
  
## Steps
1. Write code for the following functions:
    - [`pow()`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/pow/) -> `power()`
    - [`fabs()`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/fabs/) -> `absolute()`
    - [`round()`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/round/) -> `rounded()`

## Test cases
### Case 1
Run your program with the assertion tests. See [`assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert).
