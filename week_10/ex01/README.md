# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a function which counts the frequency an element appears in an array.

## Background information
Replicates python's `count()` method.
  
## Steps
1. Write code for the following function stub:
    ```cpp
    /**
     * Returns the count of number of elements of specified value.
     * 
     * @param a Container of elements. 
     * @param size Size of container.
     * @param target Element to count frequency.
     * @return Number of times `target` appears in `a`.
     */
    int frequency(string a[], int size, string target);
    ```

## Test cases
### Case 1
Run your program with the assertion tests. See [`assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert).
